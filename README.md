# Tic Tac Toe Game

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using the Tkinter library in Python. The game allows two players to take turns marking their spaces on a 3x3 grid, with the goal of getting three of their marks in a row.

## Files

- `tic_tac_toe.py`: Contains the implementation of the Tic Tac Toe game. It defines the `TicTacToe` class, which includes methods for creating the game board, handling player clicks, checking for a winner, and resetting the game board.

## How to Run the Game

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Install the Tkinter library if it is not already included with your Python installation. Tkinter is usually included with standard Python distributions.

3. Download or clone this repository to your local machine.

4. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal or command prompt.

5. Run the game by executing the following command:

   ```
   python tic_tac_toe.py
   ```

6. The Tic Tac Toe game window will open, allowing you to play the game.

## Gameplay Instructions

- Players take turns clicking on the empty squares of the grid.
- The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
- If all squares are filled and no player has three in a row, the game ends in a tie.

Enjoy playing Tic Tac Toe!
